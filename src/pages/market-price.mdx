# Market Price - Powered By Pyth + Drift Integration

For our vaults and bot actions we use prices directly from pyth and drift to ensure that prices are always up to date and with as little delay as possible.
This way we can offer our clients fast and secure entries without having a major impact on the market.

## Vaults

Our owned vaults are using the pyth oracle to get the latest price for the assets we are using and then we open the position in the drift protocol.
