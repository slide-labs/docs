# FAQ

## How to create a trade?

Connect your wallet, and click the '[Create a new trading](https://trade.slidelabs.xyz/tradings/new-trading)' button on top of the '[Tradings](https://trade.slidelabs.xyz/tradings)' page. After creation, fundraising begins, and our bots will take care of all the rest.

## What is needed to make a trade?

You need about 5 minutes and 0.015 SOL to create a new operation.

## How many trades can I do at the same time?

As many as you want.

## Can I cancel a trade after it has been initiated?

No, after creating the trade, our bots will take care of everything. We will only make it available to close the trade if the fundraising is over and the planned entry has not yet been reached.

## Can I edit the trade after it has been initiated?

That's not possible.

## How can I connect with people and trade together?

In the '[Tradings](https://trade.slidelabs.xyz/tradings)' tab, you will find several open trades. You can choose the one you would like to join, and participate in the operation. Additionally, we have provided a comment area, a real-time currency graph, and a chat feature where you can invite others to join the trade or discuss anything else.

## What happens if I lose a trade?

Unfortunately, you will lose the value with which you entered the operation.

## Can I enter a trade without investing?

As the creator of the trade, you will only have to cover the cost of 0.015 SOL. However, if other people join the trade with you and it turns out to be successful, you will earn a portion of the profits.

## How do I get my money from a successful trade?

Once a trade is completed, your profits are automatically sent to the wallet associated with your account by our bots. You don't need to worry about manually transferring the funds.
