- **Title**: Choose a title for your trade.
- **Time for funding**: Choose the amount of hours your trade will last on the platform.
- **Description**: By adding a description to your trade, you can educate others that want to invest or just inform them about something.

- **Trade direction**: Set the direction of the trade. Will the asset go up in price: **LONG**. Will the asset go down in price: **SHORT**.
- **Leverage**: Set the leverage multiplier for the trade. More info about leveraging can be found [here](./faq#what-is-leveraging). Quick summary: the larger leverage multiplier you choose, the more an investor can earn, but also the more an investor can lose ([liquidation](./faq#what-is-liquidation)).
- **Entry price**: By default the entry prices equals the current asset price. This entry price can be changed as you desire. Keep in mind that users can only invest in your trade if the asset reaches the entry price. If the entry price is not reached within the time for funding, the trade will result in a fail.
- **Planned target**: This indicates what price the asset will reach. If an active trade reaches the planned target, the trade closes and results in a success. Investors will receive their payouts.
